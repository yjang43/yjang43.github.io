            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The project trains Transformer model with word embeddings pretrained with Word2Vec(CBOW) model.
                Scripts from the TV show Friends are used as data.
                Once training is done, user can talk to the computer.
                Although it was challenging to build a model mostly referring to Vaswani's paper <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>"Attention is All You Need</a>,
                time and effort spent on this project defintely helped me grow.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty and Solution</h4>
            <p>
                As this was my first serious NLP project. I had encountered many challenges.
                One major issue was that it required too much time to train a model due to the comlexity of models and limitation of local machine's computing power.
                This naturally forced me to look into other platforms to train the models.
                To resolve this issue, I used Google Colab which provides free GPU virtual machines.
                In the future, I hope to use AWS service once I become familiar with that.
            </p>
            <h4>Improvements to Be Made</h4>
            <p>
                There are several improvements that can be made. First, I have omitted cross validation step, 
                so Transformer model may have an overfitting issue. 
                Also, instead of greedy decoding, other decoding algorithms such as Beam search can be considered.
                As the main goal of this project was to have NLP model working, it lacks performance metric or introduction of baseline.
                It will be beneficial for the performance to include those aspects.

                Algotrade is a python application that allows automation of crypto currency trade

            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                It was difficult to have a control of growing scale of the project as we add more and more functionality
                to the program. Especially file control and code tracing became a load of work every time there comes a
                need of adjustment.

            <h4>My Solution</h4>

            <p>
                There are so much data in the Internet, and yet they need data cleaning to be used in a Neural Network.
                To overcome the lack of clean data, I used hierarchical clustering algorithm with PCA to let machine label
                data.
            </p>
            <h4>Limitation to Note</h4>
            <p>
                The result of the project did not reach my expectation. Only the small portion of the original data
                was able to be labeled by the program. Also, due to the ambiguity that data transformation (PCA) creates,
                the arbitrary classification becomes insensible to human.

            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p>
                Although the project did not match to my expectation, I learned a scientific approach to ML problems,
                and this project is only the beginning of my journey to ML.

            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                As an intern at PiLab, I was given a task to develop an efficient algorithm to return a price
                <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07140>Oracle</a> for a DeFi project.
                Learning that it lacks the definition of what the correct Oracle is, I had to set my own definition
                to seek for the best algorithm: resistance to market noise.
                Then, I made a simulator to visualize how each algorithm copes with market noise.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The project can retrieve and organize current market data into a pickle format that can be fed through
                the simulator. Then, it allows users to tweak each market data by clicking options. Then, by pressing
                an Oracle button, the program tells how resistant the Oracle is to the market noise.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                Blockchain was an unfamiliar concept to me, and it required some time to understand the basics of
                technology and importance of Oracle. Make matters worse, as there is no clear discrete answer to such
                ambiguous problem (what is "the" oracle), it was difficult to set a direction in the beginning.
            </p>
            <h4>My Solution</h4>
            <p>
                From a Blockchain context, it can never be a perfect Oracle only with an algorithmic approach as
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Environment</a> needs to be
                considered. It requires network or hardware approach as
                well. Aside from such limitation, however, I read academic paper, articles, and compared with Oracle
                solutions of other DeFi examples to come out with the best algorithmic approach and realistic solution.

            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                To Social Science Computing Cooperative, UW-Madison, I provided a python code to parse and export
                numerous HTML files into an XML file.
                This allowed to automate and fasten the process of migrating around 200 documents.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The script reformats HTML documents into XML so that they can be migrated to a new KB site. Prior to this,
                the script crawled <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu">https://ssc.wisc.edu</a> to receive all the documents
                within the domain, and then parsed to fit the required format.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                Web migration is a tricky operation to first-comer of such project because the project always sits on
                the risk of starting from the beginning if one does not know what's ahead. For example, we needed to
                preserve the mapping of our website because links within each document breaks without a proper mapping.
            </p>
            <h4>My Solution</h4>
            <p>
                There were many articles regarding the web migration, so I read to prevent us from slowing down the project.
                Also, I addressed the possible issues to my coworkers and mostly was able to find a better solution, through
                out communication.
