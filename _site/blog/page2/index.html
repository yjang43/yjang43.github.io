    <h1>Bifrost, Possible Solution for DApp</h1>
    20 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>The whole reason I came across the idea of DApp is because of the interview
with a company called <em><a href="https://pilab.co/">Pilab</a></em>. This company tries to seek a solution
for a dilemma that DApp’s platform always have: trade-offs in choosing a platform for the service.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://thebifrost.io/static/Bifrost_WP_Eng.pdf">Bifrost’s white paper</a></em> was interesting reading.
Even if I lacked a DApp background, with a simple understanding of block chain in general, and private and public
block chain, I was able to understand what problem Bifrost intend to solve.</p>

<p>According to the document, each block chain platform has a different focus as to
its implementation and ecosystem. Some focuses on scalability, and other focuses
on security and beyond.</p>

<p>As a programmer that needs to choose solely one platform, the risk or loss for
completely giving in one platform is a huge risk. Bifrost comes into place and solve
this dilemma by suggesting a framework, so to speak, that allows running two block
chain platforms in parallel from my understanding. My first concern was decrease in
its efficiency due to running two platforms compared to one, but they are working on
creating its own language called <em>Recipe</em> that optimizes its performance.</p>

<p>I am excited to learn more about this technology in the future.</p>

    <h1>Training Hyperplane for Support Vector Machine</h1>
    19 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>We have this simple function of an hyperplane.
\(\mathbf{\omega \cdot x} + b = 0\)
However, getting the optimized hyperplane for SVM
is not so easy as this function looks.</p>

<p>To get an hyperplane that meets the condition,
\(y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right) \geq 1\)
and maximum margin, one can approach by minimizing a loss function of this
operation.</p>

\[min_{w, b} \: {1 \over 2}\|\omega\|^{2} 
+ C \sum max\{0, 1 - y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right)\}\]

<p>This can be solved by (sub-) gradient descent methods. A <a href="https://svivek.com/teaching/lectures/slides/svm/svm-sgd.pdf">lecture note from
University of Utah</a>
explains the procedure well. The lecture note suggests stochastic 
gradient descent for the computation speed.</p>

    <h1>Primal Support Vector Machine</h1>
    19 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>In a case where you need to draw a hyperplane that does
binary classification, there can be multiple hyperplanes.
Primal SVM is one way to solve this issue by bringing the
concept that maximizes a margin of the hyper vector.</p>

<p>Before anything, definition of margin needs to be settled.
Margin is a distance from a hyperplane to its closest data points.</p>

<p><em>“Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis said when the margin
is large, the “complexity” of the function is low, and hence learning
is possible.”</em></p>

<p>From one of the methods that derives the margin called
<em>hard margin SVM</em>, you see it focuses on getting the
minimal value of</p>

\[{1 \over 2} \|\omega\|^{2}\]

<p>while assuming the set margin of length 1.
This seems to contradict the goal, to find the max
margin. Through mathematical tweaks, however, this
equation is equivalent to the meaning of getting
the max margin.</p>

    <h1>Readings about Object Detection</h1>
    01 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>I am reading a journal from <em>IEEE</em> and decided to 
record some of the learning points from the reading.
<em>Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review</em> by Zhao
and others thoroughly reviews on the development of
object detection and its future as well.</p>

<p>There are two requirements to detect object:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>object localization</em> - where the object is located
from the frame</li>
  <li><em>object classification</em> - what is the object</li>
</ol>

<p>The author states that <em>supported vector machine</em> (SVM)
was used often for classification, so let’s learn more
about that.</p>

<p>SVM is a classification technique that can be used
in supervised learning model. The idea is that
if there are <em>k</em>-dimension vectors than it separates
vectors with <em>(k-1)</em>-dimension hyperplane that 
maximizes distance from nearest data point from
each side is maximized.</p>

<p>However, occurrence of convolutional neural network (CNN)
was the game changer. Changing technology brings
these advantages to CNN:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ImageNet - big ass data set to train the model</li>
  <li>faster GPU specs</li>
  <li>better design of structures like <em>autoencoder</em> or 
<em>restricted Boltzmann machine</em> to avoid preexisting
issues</li>
</ol>
