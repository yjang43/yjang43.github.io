                <p>In a case where you need to draw a hyperplane that does
binary classification, there can be multiple hyperplanes.
Primal SVM is one way to solve this issue by bringing the
concept that maximizes a margin of the hyper vector.</p>

<p>Before anything, definition of margin needs to be settled.
Margin is a distance from a hyperplane to its closest data points.</p>

<p><em>“Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis said when the margin
is large, the “complexity” of the function is low, and hence learning
is possible.”</em></p>

<p>From one of the methods that derives the margin called
<em>hard margin SVM</em>, you see it focuses on getting the
minimal value of</p>

\[{1 \over 2} \|\omega\|^{2}\]

<p>while assuming the set margin of length 1.
This seems to contradict the goal, to find the max
margin. Through mathematical tweaks, however, this
equation is equivalent to the meaning of getting
the max margin.</p>

            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>I am reading a journal from <em>IEEE</em> and decided to 
record some of the learning points from the reading.
<em>Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review</em> by Zhao
and others thoroughly reviews on the development of
object detection and its future as well.</p>

<p>There are two requirements to detect object:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>object localization</em> - where the object is located
from the frame</li>
  <li><em>object classification</em> - what is the object</li>
</ol>

<p>The author states that <em>supported vector machine</em> (SVM)
was used often for classification, so let’s learn more
about that.</p>

<p>SVM is a classification technique that can be used
in supervised learning model. The idea is that
if there are <em>k</em>-dimension vectors than it separates
vectors with <em>(k-1)</em>-dimension hyperplane that 
maximizes distance from nearest data point from
each side is maximized.</p>

<p>However, occurrence of convolutional neural network (CNN)
was the game changer. Changing technology brings
these advantages to CNN:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ImageNet - big ass data set to train the model</li>
  <li>faster GPU specs</li>
  <li>better design of structures like <em>autoencoder</em> or 
<em>restricted Boltzmann machine</em> to avoid preexisting
issues</li>
</ol>

            <h4>How to Properly Use Relative Import</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>As I learn more about file control in Python, I
stumbled upon two options for import: absolute
import and relative import.</p>

<p>Prior to that, there is a need of understanding 
how import system works in Python.</p>

<p>When import occurs, Python finds the package, module
, resource, or whatever you attempt to retrieve
in the order of sys.modules(cache for modules),
built-in modules, and list of directories defined
by sys.path (current directory and etc.).</p>

<p>With this in mind, absolute import is done by showing
import path starting from any directory found from
the process above. Otherwise, relative path gives
freedom to import sources relative to the file
location.</p>

<p>This is useful but there are caveats.</p>

<p>When I tried to achieve relative import, it caused
an error as such:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"test.py"</span>, line 1, <span class="k">in</span> &lt;module&gt;
    from .word_vector import <span class="k">*</span>
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>my file structure looked like this:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nlpyj
    <span class="nt">-text</span>
        -...
    <span class="nt">-word_vector</span>.py
    <span class="nt">-test</span>.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and with in test.py</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># test.py
</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">.word_vector</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem was that my test.py file ran
within the package and it prevented Python to realize
word_vector.py is a part of the package. word_vector.py
was found <em>way to early</em> according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time.</p>

<p>The link explains nitty gritty of why Python throws
such error. I think the best to avoid is to understand
the caveat of relative import and don’t use it unless
you really need to.</p>

                <p>Python is my favorite language and yet I know so small compared to my passion for it. So, I looked through python documents because I recently stumbled upon socket programming and package in python and realized there are so many interesting built-in packages in python.</p>

<p>There is a package called threading. Thread instance can be created with Thread class and other instances for communication between threads can be created.</p>

<p>Ones I found easy to understand and important were Thread, Timer, and Event. One thing I found interesting is that standard way of terminating a thread is not provided in the document. There are few suggestions from online like causing exception, or hidden function _stop().</p>

<p>Python’s queue package can be used to manage data between threads.</p>

            <h4>AWS Deployment, Check for Compatibility</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>I used Django 3.0.5 to develop my portfolio website originally.
Unfortunately, I overlooked the version compatibility of AWS with Django.
The specified version was 2.1.1 with Python 3.6 the latest.
This made me configure the project to 2.1.1, basically recreating the project and moving the file in to the project root.
I think one of the reasons why AWS is maintaining such compatibility is due to SQLite.
Once I did</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eb logs
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I found out that SQLite 3.8 which is a default db provided by Django is not provided by AWS
(it still maintained 3.7 version).</p>

<p>This made me reconsider the value of virtualenv sciprt.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew <span class="nb">install </span>pyenv
pyenv <span class="nb">install </span>3.6
virtualenv <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="o">[</span>LOCATION_OF_PYTHON_INSTALLED]/bin/python.3.6 <span class="o">[</span>VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT]
<span class="nb">source</span> <span class="o">[</span>VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT]/bin/activate
...

deactivate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gets very handy when I have to face compatibility issue.</p>

                <p>GitHub page is not something new to me. When I first
learned about HTML and CSS, like all others wanted to do,
I tried to create a phat personal website.
However, I knew so little to make it look okay.</p>

<p>Several months later, as I learn more about website hosting
and etc. I realized there is no cheap way <em>for a college student like me</em>
to host a dynamic web sites. Reason is simple, you need a computer to
compute and render. So, I came back to GitHub page because they are free.
Then, I looked for static site generator that GitHub supports.</p>

<p>Jekyll was a standard one and very easy to understand. Some of the terms
were quite knew to me because Jekyll was a Ruby product, but many of them
can be disregarded without backfiring at your project.</p>
