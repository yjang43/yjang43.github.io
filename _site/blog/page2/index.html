    <h1>Training Hyperplane for Support Vector Machine</h1>
    19 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>We have this simple function of an hyperplane.
\(\mathbf{\omega \cdot x} + b = 0\)
However, getting the optimized hyperplane for SVM
is not so easy as this function looks.</p>

<p>To get an hyperplane that meets the condition,
\(y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right) \geq 1\)
and maximum margin, one can approach by minimizing a loss function of this
operation.</p>

\[min_{w, b} \: {1 \over 2}\|\omega\|^{2} 
+ C \sum max\{0, 1 - y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right)\}\]

<p>This can be solved by (sub-) gradient descent methods. A <a href="https://svivek.com/teaching/lectures/slides/svm/svm-sgd.pdf">lecture note from
University of Utah</a>
explains the procedure well. The lecture note suggests stochastic 
gradient descent for the computation speed.</p>

    <h1>Primal Support Vector Machine</h1>
    19 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>In a case where you need to draw a hyperplane that does
binary classification, there can be multiple hyperplanes.
Primal SVM is one way to solve this issue by bringing the
concept that maximizes a margin of the hyper vector.</p>

<p>Before anything, definition of margin needs to be settled.
Margin is a distance from a hyperplane to its closest data points.</p>

<p><em>“Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis said when the margin
is large, the “complexity” of the function is low, and hence learning
is possible.”</em></p>

<p>From one of the methods that derives the margin called
<em>hard margin SVM</em>, you see it focuses on getting the
minimal value of</p>

\[{1 \over 2} \|\omega\|^{2}\]

<p>while assuming the set margin of length 1.
This seems to contradict the goal, to find the max
margin. Through mathematical tweaks, however, this
equation is equivalent to the meaning of getting
the max margin.</p>

    <h1>Readings about Object Detection</h1>
    01 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>I am reading a journal from <em>IEEE</em> and decided to 
record some of the learning points from the reading.
<em>Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review</em> by Zhao
and others thoroughly reviews on the development of
object detection and its future as well.</p>

<p>There are two requirements to detect object:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>object localization</em> - where the object is located
from the frame</li>
  <li><em>object classification</em> - what is the object</li>
</ol>

<p>The author states that <em>supported vector machine</em> (SVM)
was used often for classification, so let’s learn more
about that.</p>

<p>SVM is a classification technique that can be used
in supervised learning model. The idea is that
if there are <em>k</em>-dimension vectors than it separates
vectors with <em>(k-1)</em>-dimension hyperplane that 
maximizes distance from nearest data point from
each side is maximized.</p>

<p>However, occurrence of convolutional neural network (CNN)
was the game changer. Changing technology brings
these advantages to CNN:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ImageNet - big ass data set to train the model</li>
  <li>faster GPU specs</li>
  <li>better design of structures like <em>autoencoder</em> or 
<em>restricted Boltzmann machine</em> to avoid preexisting
issues</li>
</ol>

    <h1>How to Properly Use Relative Import</h1>
    31 May 2020<br><br>
    <p>As I learn more about file control in Python, I
stumbled upon two options for import: absolute
import and relative import.</p>

<p>Prior to that, there is a need of understanding 
how import system works in Python.</p>

<p>When import occurs, Python finds the package, module
, resource, or whatever you attempt to retrieve
in the order of sys.modules(cache for modules),
built-in modules, and list of directories defined
by sys.path (current directory and etc.).</p>

<p>With this in mind, absolute import is done by showing
import path starting from any directory found from
the process above. Otherwise, relative path gives
freedom to import sources relative to the file
location.</p>

<p>This is useful but there are caveats.</p>

<p>When I tried to achieve relative import, it caused
an error as such:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"test.py"</span>, line 1, <span class="k">in</span> &lt;module&gt;
    from .word_vector import <span class="k">*</span>
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>my file structure looked like this:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nlpyj
    <span class="nt">-text</span>
        -...
    <span class="nt">-word_vector</span>.py
    <span class="nt">-test</span>.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and with in test.py</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># test.py
</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">.word_vector</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem was that my test.py file ran
within the package and it prevented Python to realize
word_vector.py is a part of the package. word_vector.py
was found <em>way to early</em> according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time.</p>

<p>The link explains nitty gritty of why Python throws
such error. I think the best to avoid is to understand
the caveat of relative import and don’t use it unless
you really need to.</p>
