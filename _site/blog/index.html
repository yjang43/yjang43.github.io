    <h1>Attention Is All You Need - Transformer</h1>
    03 Dec 2020<br><br>
    <h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>The paper, “Attention Is All You Need”, is the first to present transformer architecture.
The attention mehanism that this architecture implements is capable of representing dependencies of words without a sequential structure like RNN.
This let the transformer architecture utilize the parallel computation with GPU. This is difficult to acheive in RNN models because of its sequential structure.
The paper states tthe three motifs of self-attention mechanism. One, computational complexity per layer. Two, parallelization. Three, path length for long-range dependencies for inputs. The table below shows the comparison with other networks.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_table.png" alt="transformer rnn cnn comparison table" width="800" />
</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>I recommend looking back at the article for more details because this part will only stay simple focus more on the overview of the architecture.
Below is the diagram,</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_architecture.png" alt="transformer architecture" width="450" />
</p>
<p>Left part of the diagram is an encoder (multi-head self-attention mechanism + fully connected feed-forward network) and the right is a decoder (multi-head attention over output + multi-head attention connecting encoder and decoder + fully connected feed-forawrd).</p>
<h4 id="encoder">Encoder</h4>
<p>Starting from the bottom of the encoder, input embedding is done like many other networks into \(d_{model}\) dimension.
Positional encoding is added to the embeddings. From the candidates of positional encodings, one using sine and consine functions is used. I need more background to understand this implementation.
Then, this gets fed into <em>multi-head attention</em> or scaled dot-product attention layer. This layer is the highlight of the paper, and used in both encoder and encoder and even encoder-decoder in which encoder connects to decoder. 
Difference between multi-head attention and scaled dot-product attention is simply the latter is the single-head version of the former.
We can use parallelization in this step by using multi-head instead.
Here is a diagram of multi-head attention mechansim.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/attention_diagram.png" alt="attention diagram" width="800" />
</p>

<p>The idea is simply taking a dot product of <em>query</em> vector and <em>key</em> vector to decide the weight to put on the <em>value</em> vector. This shows the depencies of values. 
Then the result gets fed into a feed-forward network with one hidden layer with ReLU activation.</p>

<h4 id="decoder">Decoder</h4>
<p>Input embedding and positional encoding is identical to an encoder. Also, a feed-forward network after the attention mechanism layer is identical. However, the attention mechanism layers for decoder have some subtle difference. Self-attention layer attends up to the current point which means position after the current point needs to be masked.
This masking stage is shown in the diagram as “Mask (opt.)” and mask is done by putting \(-inf\) to the position after the current point.
Attention layer for connecting encoder and decoder is different to other attention layers in a sense that <em>query</em> comes from the decoder step and <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> comes from the encoder step.</p>

<p>The overview of transformer ends here. It was a great fun reading the paper. In addition to the link to the paper, I leave a link of YouTube video that explains the structure in much more detail with visuals.</p>

    <h1>Hidden Markov Model and Algorithms - 1</h1>
    23 Nov 2020<br><br>
    <h3 id="hidden-markov-model">Hidden Markov Model</h3>
<p>HMM is easy to understand knowing its components first.
HMM can represent a sequence of <em>states</em> and <em>symbol</em>.
Symbol is what we observe, 
and state is an information about the symbol.
Simply said, HMM focuses on understanding the meaning of the observed sequence (implication under observation).</p>

<p>If state at location <em>i</em> is denoted as \(\pi_i\).
Probability of a state <em>k</em> to state <em>l</em> is expressed as,</p>

\[a_{kl} = P(\pi=l|\pi=k)\]

<p>This is called <em>transition probability</em> and carries an important role in explaining the first part of HMM, states.
Next, the probability of a symbol in a given state can be denoted as,</p>

<p>\(e_k(b) = P(x_i=b|\pi=k)\)
This is called <em>emission probability</em> and likewise this explains the second part of HMM, symbol.</p>

<h3 id="viterbi">Viterbi</h3>
<p>One question to ask while working with a squential data whose formation is determined by probability is, 
“what is the most probable meaning of the observed sequence?”
This in other words is to ask what the most probable <em>state path</em> is.</p>

\[\tilde{\pi} = argmax_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>Viterbi algorithm provides a solution to this question. The heart of the algorithm is dynamic programming, and the idea comes from the following:</p>

<p><em>If the last state \(\pi_n\) completes the most probable state path, it is completed by connecting to the most probable state path up to \(\pi_{n-1}\)</em></p>

\[v_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\max_k(v_k(i)a_{kl})\]

<p>Here <em>i</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>k</em> indicate a position in the squence, a state in question, and a previous state respectively.</p>

<h3 id="forward-algorithm">Forward Algorithm</h3>

<p>Forward algorithm gives a probabilty of a sequence, \(P(x)\) 
simple as that.</p>

\[P(x)=\sum_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>This is a marginalization of states. This can be solved with dynamic programming because \(P(x_1...x_{i}, \pi_i) = \sum_k^l P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i, \pi_{i-1}=k)\).</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

\[when \ f_k(i) = P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i=k)\]

\[f_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\sum^l_k f_k(i)a_{kl}\]

<p>The weighted sum of the probabilities of previous sequence from each state is quite intuitive.</p>

    <h1>Vanilla RNN</h1>
    21 Nov 2020<br><br>
    <h3 id="motif">Motif</h3>
<p>Language model is the probability of a sequence.
This can be approximated as the product of <em>n</em>-gram,</p>

\[P(w_1,w_2,...,w_m)=\prod^{i=m}_{i=1}P(w_i|w_1,...,w_{i-1})\approx\prod^{i=m}_{i=1}P(w_i|w_1,...,w_{i-1})\]

<p>So, <em>n</em>-gram was a natural approach to do language modeling.
However, this traditional approach has two limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>sparsity of <em>n</em>-gram</li>
  <li>exponential growth in model size as <em>n</em> increases</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vanila-rnn">Vanila RNN</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/rnn_structure.png" alt="RNN structure" align="center" width="450" /></p>

<p>In contrast to the complex network of RNN,
equations to express the network is surprisingly very simple.
This is because weights are repeated used throughout timestamps.</p>

\[h_t=\sigma(W_hh_{t-1} + W_ex_t)\]

\[\hat{y}=softmax(Uh_t)\]

<p>Here are short description of dimensions of each parameter.</p>

\[x_t\in\mathbb{R}^d\]

\[W_e\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h\times d}\]

\[W_h\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h\times D_h}\]

\[h_{t-1}\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h}\]

\[\hat{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|}\]

\[U\in\mathbb{R}^{|V| \times D_h}\]

<p>\(d\) indicates dimension of word embeddings <em>(possibly with Word2Vec)</em>, 
\(D_h\) is a dimension chosen in design. 
\(|V|\) is the cardinality of the corpus.</p>

<p>Now the structure of RNN is clear, I will discuss the loss and gradient of RNN.
First, loss function looks like this.</p>

\[J^{(t)}(\Theta) = - \sum^{|V|}_{j=1}y_{t,j}\times log(\hat{y}_{t,j})\]

\[J = {1\over T} \sum^{T}_{t=1}J^{(t)}(\Theta)\]

<p>Here, cross entropy is used to define a distance of proabability.
The loss function of RNN looks a little bit complicated, but it is explained intuitively by looking at the structure of RNN.
\(J^{(t)}\) indicates a loss at a timestamp \(t\). 
Then \(J\) indicates the overall loss of the RNN which is a summation over each timeframe and averaged by dividing the sum by the corpus size.</p>

<p>Second, gradient looks complicated as well.</p>

\[{\partial J \over \partial W} = \sum^T_{t=1}{\partial J_t \over \partial W}\]

\[{\partial J_t \over \partial W} = \sum^t_{k=1} {\partial J_t \over \partial y_t}{\partial y_t \over \partial h_t}{\partial h_t \over \partial h_k}{\partial h_k \over \partial W}\]

<p>However, this again is explained intuitively. Similar to how loss at each timestamp is added for an overall loss, overall gradient can decompose into a sum of gradient at each timestamp. Then, gradient at each timestamp is a sum of gradient that imposes change to \(y_t\). This is a multiplication of local gradients in sequence.</p>

<h3 id="problem-with-vanila-rnn">Problem With Vanila RNN</h3>
<p>With a close look at how gradient is computed in vanila RNN, we find a problem. if elements in each local gradient is bigger than 1, the overall gradient will explode, and vanish otherwise. Each we call <em>exploding gradient</em> and <em>vanishing gradient</em> respectively. Thus, variation of RNNs are devised in newer literatures.</p>

    <h1>Bifrost, Possible Solution for DApp</h1>
    20 Jun 2020<br><br>
    <p>The whole reason I came across the idea of DApp is because of the interview
with a company called <em><a href="https://pilab.co/">Pilab</a></em>. This company tries to seek a solution
for a dilemma that DApp’s platform always have: trade-offs in choosing a platform for the service.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://thebifrost.io/static/Bifrost_WP_Eng.pdf">Bifrost’s white paper</a></em> was interesting reading.
Even if I lacked a DApp background, with a simple understanding of block chain in general, and private and public
block chain, I was able to understand what problem Bifrost intend to solve.</p>

<p>According to the document, each block chain platform has a different focus as to
its implementation and ecosystem. Some focuses on scalability, and other focuses
on security and beyond.</p>

<p>As a programmer that needs to choose solely one platform, the risk or loss for
completely giving in one platform is a huge risk. Bifrost comes into place and solve
this dilemma by suggesting a framework, so to speak, that allows running two block
chain platforms in parallel from my understanding. My first concern was decrease in
its efficiency due to running two platforms compared to one, but they are working on
creating its own language called <em>Recipe</em> that optimizes its performance.</p>

<p>I am excited to learn more about this technology in the future.</p>
