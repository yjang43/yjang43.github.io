    <h1>Learning Xavier Initialization</h1>
    10 Jan 2021<br><br>
    <p>Learning PyTorch, I happened to come across a function called <em>reset_parameters()</em>.
This function included xavier initalization instead of standard initialization.
So, I decided to read Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio’s “Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks”.
The origin paper of Xavier intialization gave me great undersatnding of its objective.</p>

<h3 id="xavier-initialization">Xavier Initialization</h3>

<p>Objectives of Xavier initialization are simply all about managing variance,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining variance of forward propagation.<br />
Each neuron should equally contribute to right prediction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining variance of backward propagation<br />
Back propagation should not be susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradient.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The part that interested me the most is how variance can be calculated and multiplied and added according to the number of layers and hidden neurons within each layer.</p>

\[Var[z^i]  = Var[x]\prod^{i-1}_{i^{'}=0}n_{i^{'}}Var[W^{i^{'}}]\]

<p>Moving forward, the authors present the following way to intialize weights from such distribution,</p>

\[W \sim U\Big[-{\sqrt{3}\over{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}}, {\sqrt{3}\over{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}}\Big]\]

<h3 id="additional-study">Additional Study</h3>
<p>Although introduction of Xavier initialization is the main meal of the paper, I enjoyed learning other points made by the authors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to choose a good activation function.
<br />
For example, sigmoid shows a quick saturation of hidden layer in the output.
It makes sense because in the early training period, bias overrules features in neurons.
This restricts lower layers to learn meaningful features, and thus slower learning.
Choosing zero-mean activation function line tanh can avoid the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to choose a right loss function.
<br />
The authors compared the result between quadratic(LSE) and cross entropy. 
Result shows quadratic loss function gives more plateaus, which I assume it means slower training (flatness gives smaller gradient).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <h1>Understanding Autograd in PyTorch</h1>
    23 Dec 2020<br><br>
    <p>I find it very important to understand what autograd is more than simply viewing as a PyTorch engine that computes gradient automatically for us.
Accurately, autograd is an engine for Jacobian-vector product (JVP).
I will cover two things, cycle of its operation and JVP</p>
<h3 id="operation-cycle">Operation Cycle</h3>
<p>Autograd is possible because operations on Tensors are recorded, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), or more specifically dynamic computational graph (DCG), is craeted along with it.
In a view of graph, nodes are Tensors, and edges are operations.</p>

<p>Tensor holds the following important information:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>data</em>: value a Tensor is holding.</li>
  <li><em>requires_grad</em>: <em>VERY IMPORTANT!</em> tracks operation and forms backward graph which allows backpropagation.</li>
  <li><em>grad</em>: stores computed gradient.</li>
  <li><em>grad_fn</em>: backward function used to compute gradient.</li>
  <li><em>is_leaf</em>: tells if the node is leaf of DCG</li>
</ol>

<p>While the importance of other attributes are self explanatory, it seems odd to store <em>is_leaf</em>.
However, this becomes an important bit because gradient of Tensor is populated only if <em>requires_grad</em> and <em>is_leaf</em> are set to True.</p>

<h3 id="jvp">JVP</h3>
<p>When I was going through <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py">tutorials</a> on PyTorch, I found this part very weird and arbitrary.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">torch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">tensor</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.0001</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">dtype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">torch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This explains the case when we call <em>backward()</em> function from non-scalar output. 
To understand this, I had to learn PyTorch does not (or cannot) compute Jacobian directly to purse simplicity and efficiency.
It uses JVP instead which simply is an inner product of vector and Jacobian.
Normally, the root of DAG, or DCG, of autograd is an output from loss function, simply a scalar value.
This kind of eliminates a reason to compute Jacobian directly and lets us assume computation of gradient always start from a scalar value.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/JVP.png" alt="JVP" width="30%" />
</p>

<p>This does not mean we cannot compute Jacobian.
An example by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43451125/pytorch-what-are-the-gradient-arguments/47026836">jdhao</a> gives an intuitive explanation on why and how to directly compute Jacobian.</p>

    <h1>Attention Is All You Need - Transformer</h1>
    03 Dec 2020<br><br>
    <h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>The paper, “Attention Is All You Need”, is the first to present transformer architecture.
The attention mehanism that this architecture implements is capable of representing dependencies of words without a sequential structure like RNN.
This let the transformer architecture utilize the parallel computation with GPU. This is difficult to acheive in RNN models because of its sequential structure.
The paper states tthe three motifs of self-attention mechanism. One, computational complexity per layer. Two, parallelization. Three, path length for long-range dependencies for inputs. The table below shows the comparison with other networks.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_table.png" alt="transformer rnn cnn comparison table" width="75%" />
</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>I recommend looking back at the article for more details because this part will only stay simple focus more on the overview of the architecture.
Below is the diagram,</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_architecture.png" alt="transformer architecture" width="40%" />
</p>
<p>Left part of the diagram is an encoder (multi-head self-attention mechanism + fully connected feed-forward network) and the right is a decoder (multi-head attention over output + multi-head attention connecting encoder and decoder + fully connected feed-forawrd).</p>
<h4 id="encoder">Encoder</h4>
<p>Starting from the bottom of the encoder, input embedding is done like many other networks into \(d_{model}\) dimension.
Positional encoding is added to the embeddings. From the candidates of positional encodings, one using sine and consine functions is used. I need more background to understand this implementation.
Then, this gets fed into <em>multi-head attention</em> or scaled dot-product attention layer. This layer is the highlight of the paper, and used in both encoder and encoder and even encoder-decoder in which encoder connects to decoder. 
Difference between multi-head attention and scaled dot-product attention is simply the latter is the single-head version of the former.
We can use parallelization in this step by using multi-head instead.
Here is a diagram of multi-head attention mechansim.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/attention_diagram.png" alt="attention diagram" width="75%" />
</p>

<p>The idea is simply taking a dot product of <em>query</em> vector and <em>key</em> vector to decide the weight to put on the <em>value</em> vector. This shows the depencies of values. 
Then the result gets fed into a feed-forward network with one hidden layer with ReLU activation.</p>

<h4 id="decoder">Decoder</h4>
<p>Input embedding and positional encoding is identical to an encoder. Also, a feed-forward network after the attention mechanism layer is identical. However, the attention mechanism layers for decoder have some subtle difference. Self-attention layer attends up to the current point which means position after the current point needs to be masked.
This masking stage is shown in the diagram as “Mask (opt.)” and mask is done by putting \(-inf\) to the position after the current point.
Attention layer for connecting encoder and decoder is different to other attention layers in a sense that <em>query</em> comes from the decoder step and <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> comes from the encoder step.</p>

<p>The overview of transformer ends here. It was a great fun reading the paper. In addition to the link to the paper, I leave a link of YouTube video that explains the structure in much more detail with visuals.</p>

    <h1>Hidden Markov Model and Algorithms - 1</h1>
    23 Nov 2020<br><br>
    <h3 id="hidden-markov-model">Hidden Markov Model</h3>
<p>HMM is easy to understand knowing its components first.
HMM can represent a sequence of <em>states</em> and <em>symbol</em>.
Symbol is what we observe, 
and state is an information about the symbol.
Simply said, HMM focuses on understanding the meaning of the observed sequence (implication under observation).</p>

<p>If state at location <em>i</em> is denoted as \(\pi_i\).
Probability of a state <em>k</em> to state <em>l</em> is expressed as,</p>

\[a_{kl} = P(\pi=l|\pi=k)\]

<p>This is called <em>transition probability</em> and carries an important role in explaining the first part of HMM, states.
Next, the probability of a symbol in a given state can be denoted as,</p>

<p>\(e_k(b) = P(x_i=b|\pi=k)\)
This is called <em>emission probability</em> and likewise this explains the second part of HMM, symbol.</p>

<h3 id="viterbi">Viterbi</h3>
<p>One question to ask while working with a squential data whose formation is determined by probability is, 
“what is the most probable meaning of the observed sequence?”
This in other words is to ask what the most probable <em>state path</em> is.</p>

\[\tilde{\pi} = argmax_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>Viterbi algorithm provides a solution to this question. The heart of the algorithm is dynamic programming, and the idea comes from the following:</p>

<p><em>If the last state \(\pi_n\) completes the most probable state path, it is completed by connecting to the most probable state path up to \(\pi_{n-1}\)</em></p>

\[v_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\max_k(v_k(i)a_{kl})\]

<p>Here <em>i</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>k</em> indicate a position in the squence, a state in question, and a previous state respectively.</p>

<h3 id="forward-algorithm">Forward Algorithm</h3>

<p>Forward algorithm gives a probabilty of a sequence, \(P(x)\) 
simple as that.</p>

\[P(x)=\sum_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>This is a marginalization of states. This can be solved with dynamic programming because \(P(x_1...x_{i}, \pi_i) = \sum_k^l P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i, \pi_{i-1}=k)\).</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

\[when \ f_k(i) = P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i=k)\]

\[f_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\sum^l_k f_k(i)a_{kl}\]

<p>The weighted sum of the probabilities of previous sequence from each state is quite intuitive.</p>
