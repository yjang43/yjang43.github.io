            <div class="blog-summary">
                <h2 id="autoencoders">Autoencoders</h2>
<p>Autoencoders is an unsupervised learning method to reduce a dimensionality of input.
The main idea is very similar to PCA, but more can be done with autoencoder, for example adding non-linearity or regularization. 
The main idea is to reconstruct an input with limitted features.
Here is a diagram of a simple autoencoder.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/autoencoder.png" alt="JVP" width="50%" />
</p>

<p>Basically, the network is composed of encoder and decoder, and lantent features (code) gives a high-level representation of input. 
Some tricks on autoencoder can result in better representation of latent features.
One I will mention is denosing autoencoders invented by Vincet(2008). By masking portion of input, it provides robust representation to partially destructed input, which aligns with the definition author proposed to be a “good” representation. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/yjang43/ml_practice/blob/master/autoencoder.ipynb">link</a> that compares the results of autoencoders and desnoising autoencoder.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-learning-with-autoencoder">Transfer Learning with Autoencoder</h2>
<p>Transfer learning is to use information from source domains, abundant data, to support tasks in target domains, small data.
Glorot(2011) proposes that stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) can extract intermediate representations from both source and target domain, and use that to help classfication task in target domain.
This idea extends to transfer learning with deep autoencoders (TLDA) by Zhuang (2015), which is a form of supervised learning unlike the usual approach with autoencoder. I have conducted an experiment to check its better performance <a href="https://github.com/yjang43/ml_practice/blob/master/TLDA.ipynb">here</a>.
Instead of using the same dataset from the paper, I used MNIST data.
The task was to check if a binary classfication of a number (ex. is the input ‘1’ when compared with ‘3’) can be transfered to another binary classification (ex. is the input ‘1’ when compared with ‘5’). 
Surprisingly, TLDA performed much better than the baseline, in which I shared parameters trained in simple DNN to another task.
Here is a comparsion of learned feature between TLDA and baseline.
You can see the learned feature from TLDA is more generalized to both the source and target domains.</p>

            <h4>Learning Xavier Initialization</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>Learning PyTorch, I happened to come across a function called <em>reset_parameters()</em>.
This function included xavier initalization instead of standard initialization.
So, I decided to read Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio’s “Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks”.
The origin paper of Xavier intialization gave me great undersatnding of its objective.</p>

<h3 id="xavier-initialization">Xavier Initialization</h3>

<p>Objectives of Xavier initialization are simply all about managing variance,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining variance of forward propagation.<br />
Each neuron should equally contribute to right prediction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining variance of backward propagation<br />
Back propagation should not be susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradient.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The part that interested me the most is how variance can be calculated and multiplied and added according to the number of layers and hidden neurons within each layer.</p>

\[Var[z^i]  = Var[x]\prod^{i-1}_{i^{'}=0}n_{i^{'}}Var[W^{i^{'}}]\]

<p>Moving forward, the authors present the following way to intialize weights from such distribution,</p>

\[W \sim U\Big[-{\sqrt{3}\over{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}}, {\sqrt{3}\over{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}}\Big]\]

<h3 id="additional-study">Additional Study</h3>
<p>Although introduction of Xavier initialization is the main meal of the paper, I enjoyed learning other points made by the authors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to choose a good activation function.
<br />
For example, sigmoid shows a quick saturation of hidden layer in the output.
It makes sense because in the early training period, bias overrules features in neurons.
This restricts lower layers to learn meaningful features, and thus slower learning.
Choosing zero-mean activation function line tanh can avoid the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to choose a right loss function.
<br />
The authors compared the result between quadratic(LSE) and cross entropy. 
Result shows quadratic loss function gives more plateaus, which I assume it means slower training (flatness gives smaller gradient).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

            <h4>Understanding Autograd in PyTorch</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>I find it very important to understand what autograd is more than simply viewing as a PyTorch engine that computes gradient automatically for us.
Accurately, autograd is an engine for Jacobian-vector product (JVP).
I will cover two things, cycle of its operation and JVP</p>
<h3 id="operation-cycle">Operation Cycle</h3>
<p>Autograd is possible because operations on Tensors are recorded, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), or more specifically dynamic computational graph (DCG), is craeted along with it.
In a view of graph, nodes are Tensors, and edges are operations.</p>

<p>Tensor holds the following important information:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>data</em>: value a Tensor is holding.</li>
  <li><em>requires_grad</em>: <em>VERY IMPORTANT!</em> tracks operation and forms backward graph which allows backpropagation.</li>
  <li><em>grad</em>: stores computed gradient.</li>
  <li><em>grad_fn</em>: backward function used to compute gradient.</li>
  <li><em>is_leaf</em>: tells if the node is leaf of DCG</li>
</ol>

<p>While the importance of other attributes are self explanatory, it seems odd to store <em>is_leaf</em>.
However, this becomes an important bit because gradient of Tensor is populated only if <em>requires_grad</em> and <em>is_leaf</em> are set to True.</p>

<h3 id="jvp">JVP</h3>
<p>When I was going through <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py">tutorials</a> on PyTorch, I found this part very weird and arbitrary.</p>

<p>This explains the case when we call <em>backward()</em> function from non-scalar output. 
To understand this, I had to learn PyTorch does not (or cannot) compute Jacobian directly to purse simplicity and efficiency.
It uses JVP instead which simply is an inner product of vector and Jacobian.
Normally, the root of DAG, or DCG, of autograd is an output from loss function, simply a scalar value.
This kind of eliminates a reason to compute Jacobian directly and lets us assume computation of gradient always start from a scalar value.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/JVP.png" alt="JVP" width="30%" />
</p>

<p>This does not mean we cannot compute Jacobian.
An example by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43451125/pytorch-what-are-the-gradient-arguments/47026836">jdhao</a> gives an intuitive explanation on why and how to directly compute Jacobian.</p>

            <h4>Attention Is All You Need - Transformer</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>The paper, “Attention Is All You Need”, is the first to present transformer architecture.
The attention mehanism that this architecture implements is capable of representing dependencies of words without a sequential structure like RNN.
This let the transformer architecture utilize the parallel computation with GPU. This is difficult to acheive in RNN models because of its sequential structure.
The paper states tthe three motifs of self-attention mechanism. One, computational complexity per layer. Two, parallelization. Three, path length for long-range dependencies for inputs. The table below shows the comparison with other networks.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_table.png" alt="transformer rnn cnn comparison table" width="75%" />
</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>I recommend looking back at the article for more details because this part will only stay simple focus more on the overview of the architecture.
Below is the diagram,</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/transformer_architecture.png" alt="transformer architecture" width="40%" />
</p>
<p>Left part of the diagram is an encoder (multi-head self-attention mechanism + fully connected feed-forward network) and the right is a decoder (multi-head attention over output + multi-head attention connecting encoder and decoder + fully connected feed-forawrd).</p>
<h4 id="encoder">Encoder</h4>
<p>Starting from the bottom of the encoder, input embedding is done like many other networks into \(d_{model}\) dimension.
Positional encoding is added to the embeddings. From the candidates of positional encodings, one using sine and consine functions is used. I need more background to understand this implementation.
Then, this gets fed into <em>multi-head attention</em> or scaled dot-product attention layer. This layer is the highlight of the paper, and used in both encoder and encoder and even encoder-decoder in which encoder connects to decoder. 
Difference between multi-head attention and scaled dot-product attention is simply the latter is the single-head version of the former.
We can use parallelization in this step by using multi-head instead.
Here is a diagram of multi-head attention mechansim.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/attention_diagram.png" alt="attention diagram" width="75%" />
</p>

<p>The idea is simply taking a dot product of <em>query</em> vector and <em>key</em> vector to decide the weight to put on the <em>value</em> vector. This shows the depencies of values. 
Then the result gets fed into a feed-forward network with one hidden layer with ReLU activation.</p>

<h4 id="decoder">Decoder</h4>
<p>Input embedding and positional encoding is identical to an encoder. Also, a feed-forward network after the attention mechanism layer is identical. However, the attention mechanism layers for decoder have some subtle difference. Self-attention layer attends up to the current point which means position after the current point needs to be masked.
This masking stage is shown in the diagram as “Mask (opt.)” and mask is done by putting \(-inf\) to the position after the current point.
Attention layer for connecting encoder and decoder is different to other attention layers in a sense that <em>query</em> comes from the decoder step and <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> comes from the encoder step.</p>

<p>The overview of transformer ends here. It was a great fun reading the paper. In addition to the link to the paper, I leave a link of YouTube video that explains the structure in much more detail with visuals.</p>

<p>HMM is easy to understand knowing its components first.
HMM can represent a sequence of <em>states</em> and <em>symbol</em>.
Symbol is what we observe, 
and state is an information about the symbol.
Simply said, HMM focuses on understanding the meaning of the observed sequence (implication under observation).</p>

<p>If state at location <em>i</em> is denoted as \(\pi_i\).
Probability of a state <em>k</em> to state <em>l</em> is expressed as,</p>

\[a_{kl} = P(\pi=l|\pi=k)\]

<p>This is called <em>transition probability</em> and carries an important role in explaining the first part of HMM, states.
Next, the probability of a symbol in a given state can be denoted as,</p>

<p>\(e_k(b) = P(x_i=b|\pi=k)\)
This is called <em>emission probability</em> and likewise this explains the second part of HMM, symbol.</p>

<h3 id="viterbi">Viterbi</h3>
<p>One question to ask while working with a squential data whose formation is determined by probability is, 
“what is the most probable meaning of the observed sequence?”
This in other words is to ask what the most probable <em>state path</em> is.</p>

\[\tilde{\pi} = argmax_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>Viterbi algorithm provides a solution to this question. The heart of the algorithm is dynamic programming, and the idea comes from the following:</p>

<p><em>If the last state \(\pi_n\) completes the most probable state path, it is completed by connecting to the most probable state path up to \(\pi_{n-1}\)</em></p>

\[v_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\max_k(v_k(i)a_{kl})\]

<p>Here <em>i</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>k</em> indicate a position in the squence, a state in question, and a previous state respectively.</p>

<h3 id="forward-algorithm">Forward Algorithm</h3>

<p>Forward algorithm gives a probabilty of a sequence, \(P(x)\) 
simple as that.</p>

\[P(x)=\sum_\pi P(x, \pi)\]

<p>This is a marginalization of states. This can be solved with dynamic programming because \(P(x_1...x_{i}, \pi_i) = \sum_k^l P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i, \pi_{i-1}=k)\).</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

\[when \ f_k(i) = P(x_1...x_i, \pi_i=k)\]

\[f_l(i+1) = e_l(x_{i+1})\sum^l_k f_k(i)a_{kl}\]

<p>The weighted sum of the probabilities of previous sequence from each state is quite intuitive.</p>

<p>Language model is the probability of a sequence.
This can be approximated as the product of <em>n</em>-gram,</p>

\[P(w_1,w_2,...,w_m)=\prod^{i=m}_{i=1}P(w_i|w_1,...,w_{i-1})\approx\prod^{i=m}_{i=1}P(w_i|w_1,...,w_{i-1})\]

<p>So, <em>n</em>-gram was a natural approach to do language modeling.
However, this traditional approach has two limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>sparsity of <em>n</em>-gram</li>
  <li>exponential growth in model size as <em>n</em> increases</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vanila-rnn">Vanila RNN</h3>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/rnn_structure.png" alt="RNN structure" width="40%" />
</p>

<p>In contrast to the complex network of RNN,
equations to express the network is surprisingly very simple.
This is because weights are repeated used throughout timestamps.</p>

\[h_t=\sigma(W_hh_{t-1} + W_ex_t)\]

\[\hat{y}=softmax(Uh_t)\]

<p>Here are short description of dimensions of each parameter.</p>

\[x_t\in\mathbb{R}^d\]

\[W_e\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h\times d}\]

\[W_h\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h\times D_h}\]

\[h_{t-1}\in\mathbb{R}^{D_h}\]

\[\hat{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|}\]

\[U\in\mathbb{R}^{|V| \times D_h}\]

<p>\(d\) indicates dimension of word embeddings <em>(possibly with Word2Vec)</em>, 
\(D_h\) is a dimension chosen in design. 
\(|V|\) is the cardinality of the corpus.</p>

<p>Now the structure of RNN is clear, I will discuss the loss and gradient of RNN.
First, loss function looks like this.</p>

\[J^{(t)}(\Theta) = - \sum^{|V|}_{j=1}y_{t,j}\times log(\hat{y}_{t,j})\]

\[J = {1\over T} \sum^{T}_{t=1}J^{(t)}(\Theta)\]

<p>Here, cross entropy is used to define a distance of proabability.
The loss function of RNN looks a little bit complicated, but it is explained intuitively by looking at the structure of RNN.
\(J^{(t)}\) indicates a loss at a timestamp \(t\). 
Then \(J\) indicates the overall loss of the RNN which is a summation over each timeframe and averaged by dividing the sum by the corpus size.</p>

<p>Second, gradient looks complicated as well.</p>

\[{\partial J \over \partial W} = \sum^T_{t=1}{\partial J_t \over \partial W}\]

\[{\partial J_t \over \partial W} = \sum^t_{k=1} {\partial J_t \over \partial y_t}{\partial y_t \over \partial h_t}{\partial h_t \over \partial h_k}{\partial h_k \over \partial W}\]

<p>However, this again is explained intuitively. Similar to how loss at each timestamp is added for an overall loss, overall gradient can decompose into a sum of gradient at each timestamp. Then, gradient at each timestamp is a sum of gradient that imposes change to \(y_t\). This is a multiplication of local gradients in sequence.</p>

<h3 id="problem-with-vanila-rnn">Problem With Vanila RNN</h3>
<p>With a close look at how gradient is computed in vanila RNN, we find a problem. if elements in each local gradient is bigger than 1, the overall gradient will explode, and vanish otherwise. Each we call <em>exploding gradient</em> and <em>vanishing gradient</em> respectively. Thus, variation of RNNs are devised in newer literatures.</p>

            <h4>Bifrost, Possible Solution for DApp</h4>
            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>The whole reason I came across the idea of DApp is because of the interview
with a company called <em><a href="https://pilab.co/">Pilab</a></em>. This company tries to seek a solution
for a dilemma that DApp’s platform always have: trade-offs in choosing a platform for the service.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://thebifrost.io/static/Bifrost_WP_Eng.pdf">Bifrost’s white paper</a></em> was interesting reading.
Even if I lacked a DApp background, with a simple understanding of block chain in general, and private and public
block chain, I was able to understand what problem Bifrost intend to solve.</p>

<p>According to the document, each block chain platform has a different focus as to
its implementation and ecosystem. Some focuses on scalability, and other focuses
on security and beyond.</p>

<p>As a programmer that needs to choose solely one platform, the risk or loss for
completely giving in one platform is a huge risk. Bifrost comes into place and solve
this dilemma by suggesting a framework, so to speak, that allows running two block
chain platforms in parallel from my understanding. My first concern was decrease in
its efficiency due to running two platforms compared to one, but they are working on
creating its own language called <em>Recipe</em> that optimizes its performance.</p>

<p>I am excited to learn more about this technology in the future.</p>

            <div class="blog-summary">
                <p>We have this simple function of an hyperplane.
\(\mathbf{\omega \cdot x} + b = 0\)
However, getting the optimized hyperplane for SVM
is not so easy as this function looks.</p>

<p>To get an hyperplane that meets the condition,
\(y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right) \geq 1\)
and maximum margin, one can approach by minimizing a loss function of this
operation.</p>

\[min_{w, b} \: {1 \over 2}\|\omega\|^{2} 
+ C \sum max\{0, 1 - y_n \left( \langle \mathbf{\omega , x_n}\rangle  + b \right)\}\]

<p>This can be solved by (sub-) gradient descent methods. A <a href="https://svivek.com/teaching/lectures/slides/svm/svm-sgd.pdf">lecture note from
University of Utah</a>
explains the procedure well. The lecture note suggests stochastic 
gradient descent for the computation speed.</p>

                <p>In a case where you need to draw a hyperplane that does
binary classification, there can be multiple hyperplanes.
Primal SVM is one way to solve this issue by bringing the
concept that maximizes a margin of the hyper vector.</p>

<p>Before anything, definition of margin needs to be settled.
Margin is a distance from a hyperplane to its closest data points.</p>

<p><em>“Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis said when the margin
is large, the “complexity” of the function is low, and hence learning
is possible.”</em></p>

<p>From one of the methods that derives the margin called
<em>hard margin SVM</em>, you see it focuses on getting the
minimal value of</p>

\[{1 \over 2} \|\omega\|^{2}\]

<p>while assuming the set margin of length 1.
This seems to contradict the goal, to find the max
margin. Through mathematical tweaks, however, this
equation is equivalent to the meaning of getting
the max margin.</p>

                <p>I am reading a journal from <em>IEEE</em> and decided to 
record some of the learning points from the reading.
<em>Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review</em> by Zhao
and others thoroughly reviews on the development of
object detection and its future as well.</p>

<p>There are two requirements to detect object:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>object localization</em> - where the object is located
from the frame</li>
  <li><em>object classification</em> - what is the object</li>
</ol>

<p>The author states that <em>supported vector machine</em> (SVM)
was used often for classification, so let’s learn more
about that.</p>

<p>SVM is a classification technique that can be used
in supervised learning model. The idea is that
if there are <em>k</em>-dimension vectors than it separates
vectors with <em>(k-1)</em>-dimension hyperplane that 
maximizes distance from nearest data point from
each side is maximized.</p>

<p>However, occurrence of convolutional neural network (CNN)
was the game changer. Changing technology brings
these advantages to CNN:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ImageNet - big ass data set to train the model</li>
  <li>faster GPU specs</li>
  <li>better design of structures like <em>autoencoder</em> or 
<em>restricted Boltzmann machine</em> to avoid preexisting
issues</li>
