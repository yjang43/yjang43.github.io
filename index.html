            <h1>Hi!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Yoo Sung Jang.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a computer science student and a hobbyist programmer.
                    Programming came across to me during my math class in 2017, and ever since, I was interested in programming.
                    The potential of programming was fascinating to me that we can put an infinite number of ideas into realization.
                    This sole idea led me to the world of programming.
                </p>

                    Creativity is the word that I always pursued to seek.
                    Creativity is my virtue, motivation, and strength.
                    This website dedicates to showcase my projects,
                    to record any blueprints of projects,
                    and to posts daily knowledge.
                    Please feel free to look around, and contact me for any questions
