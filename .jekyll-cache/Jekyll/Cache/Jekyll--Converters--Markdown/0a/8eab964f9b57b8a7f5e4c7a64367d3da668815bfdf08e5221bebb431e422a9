<p>Autoencoders is an unsupervised learning method to reduce a dimensionality of input.
The main idea is very similar to PCA, but more can be done with autoencoder, for example adding non-linearity or regularization. 
The main idea is to reconstruct an input with limitted features.
Here is a diagram of a simple autoencoder.</p>
