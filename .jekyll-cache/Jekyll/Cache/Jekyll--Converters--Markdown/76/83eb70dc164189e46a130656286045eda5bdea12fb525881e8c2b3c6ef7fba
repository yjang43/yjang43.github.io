I"i<p>Text-to-text translation in NLP with transformer architecture is commonly trained with paired set of data and same with computer vision.
The paired data is expensive and rare, thus NLP tends to remedy the issue by generating even more data, back translation for example.
In the field of computer vision, however, there exists less constraint as to the broadness of mapping from one domanin to the other.
In other words, semantic meaning should maintain strictly in text-to-text translation while image-to-image not so much. 
Cycle GAN from a paper called, <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Zhu_Unpaired_Image-To-Image_Translation_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf">Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks</a> demonstrated a promising result despite utilizing unpaired dataset, which reduces the problem of relying on expensive paired data.</p>

<h3 id="from-gan-to-cycle-gan">From GAN to Cycle GAN</h3>
<p>From the name of it, Cycle GAN uses GAN framework like many other generative models. 
GAN is a framework of two adversarial neural networks to replicate data sampled from a target distribution.</p>

    <figcaption style="color: gray; font-size:12px; text-align:center">GAN framework described from Deep Learning with PyTorch by Eli Stevens</figcaption>
</p>
<p>This framework is used in Cycle GAN in a sense that generator G generates fake data corresponds to Y domain from X domain, and generator F does vice versa. 
And provided generated data and real data, discrimnator classify real from fake data.
Below is the diagram of the flow of the architecture.</p>

<p>Here, cycle-consistency loss is an auxilary loss to maintain the retractability after a translation just like how normally text-to-text translation can be translated back to a sementically similar text. 
Thus, on top of a commonly known GAN loss, Binary Cross-Entropy loss, cycle-consistency loss is added like the following.</p>

<div style="width: 100%; overflow: scroll;">
$$\mathcal{L}_{GAN}(G, D_Y, X, Y) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_{data}(y)}[log D_Y(y)]
                                  + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[1 - log D_Y(G(x))]$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{GAN}(F, D_X, Y, X) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[log D_X(x)]
                                  + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_{data}(y)}[1 - log D_X(F(y))]$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{cyc}(G, F) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\left\Vert F(G(x)) - x \right\Vert_1]
                          + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_{data}(y)}[\left\Vert G(F(y)) - y \right\Vert_1]$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{tot}(G, F, D_X, D_Y) = \mathcal{L}_{GAN}(G, D_Y, X, Y) + \mathcal{L}_{GAN}(F, D_X, Y, X) + \mathcal{L}_{cyc}(G, F)$$
</div>

<p>And of course, like any other GAN networks, it will be trained like a minimax updating parameters of generators and discriminators taking turns.</p>

<div style="width: 100%; overflow: scroll;">
$$G^*, F^* = arg\min_{G,F}\max_{D_X,D_Y} \mathcal{L}(G, F, D_X, D_Y)$$
</div>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>

<p>Acknowledging unpaired data is used throughout the training, the outcome of what machine learned is quite fascinating. 
By having data from X domain to be drawings from Monet, and that from Y domain to be real pictures, machine learns to translate from one domanin to the other, transfering style from each domain.
This is better understood by the samples of the result presented from the paper.</p>

<p>Looking at the results provided by the paper, I see the possibilities of this model used in filming or graphic industires.</p>
