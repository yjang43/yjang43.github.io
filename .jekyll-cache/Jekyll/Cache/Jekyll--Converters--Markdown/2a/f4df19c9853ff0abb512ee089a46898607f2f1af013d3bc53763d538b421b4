I"©<p>I used Django 3.0.5 to develop my portfolio website originally.
Unfortunately, I overlooked the version compatibility of AWS with Django.
The specified version was 2.1.1 with Python 3.6 the latest.
This made me configure the project to 2.1.1, basically recreating the project and moving the file in to the project root.
I think one of the reasons why AWS is maintaining such compatibility is due to SQLite.
Once I did</p>
