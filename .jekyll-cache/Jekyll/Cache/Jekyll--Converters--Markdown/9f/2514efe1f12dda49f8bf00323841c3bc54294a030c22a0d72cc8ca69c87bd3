I"”<p>Learning PyTorch, I happened to come across a function called <em>reset_parameters()</em>.
This function included xavier initalization instead of standard initialization.
So, I decided to read Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengioâ€™s â€œUnderstanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networksâ€.
The origin paper of Xavier intialization gave me great undersatnding of its objective.</p>
