I"R<p>Benepar (Berkley Neural Parser) is a current state-of-the-art constituency parser.
The implementation of the logic is in a paper by Kitaev, “Constituency Parsing with a Self-Attentive Encoder”.
In a summary, it is a transformer architecture to made decision on the best constituency tree structure each of which are constructed by CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="context-free-grammar">Context Free Grammar</h2>
<p>To understand constituency parsing, knowing CFG (Context Free Grammar) is important.
CFG is a set of grammar rules in which one needs no prior understanding of context of a sentence.
Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S → NP VP</li>
  <li>VP → Verb NP</li>
</ul>

<p>S, NP, and VP denotes setence, noun phrase, and verb phrase respectively.
There are many more rules.
