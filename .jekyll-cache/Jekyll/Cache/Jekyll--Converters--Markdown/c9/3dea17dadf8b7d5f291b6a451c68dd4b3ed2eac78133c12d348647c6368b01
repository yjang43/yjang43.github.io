I"­<p><a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan">StyleGAN developed by NVIDIAâ€™s research team</a> has shown an exceptional result as to separating high level attributes, such as pose, face, hair, and etc., of generated data.
The success derived from the structural design of the network, via which each style is localized within the subset of the network. 
Style mixing performed by the network shows what it is capable of.</p>
