I"É<p>Benepar (Berkley Neural Parser) is a current state-of-the-art constituency parser.
The implementation of the logic is in a paper by Kitaev, â€œConstituency Parsing with a Self-Attentive Encoderâ€.
In a summary, it is a transformer architecture to made decision on the best constituency tree structure each of which are constructed by CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="context-free-grammar">Context Free Grammar</h2>
<p>To understand constituency parsing, knowing CFG (Context Free Grammar) is important.
CFG is a set of grammar rules in which one needs no prior understanding of context of a sentence.
Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S â†’ NP VP</li>
  <li>VP â†’ Verb NP</li>
</ul>
