I"—<p>Benepar (Berkley Neural Parser) is a current state-of-the-art constituency parser.
The implementation of the logic is in a paper by Kitaev, ‚ÄúConstituency Parsing with a Self-Attentive Encoder‚Äù.
In a summary, it is a transformer architecture to made decision on the best constituency tree structure each of which are constructed by CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="context-free-grammar">Context Free Grammar</h2>
<p>To understand constituency parsing, knowing CFG (Context Free Grammar) is important.
CFG is a set of grammar rules in which one needs no prior understanding of context of a sentence.
Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S ‚Üí NP VP</li>
  <li>VP ‚Üí Verb NP</li>
</ul>

<p>S, NP, and VP denotes setence, noun phrase, and verb phrase respectively.
There are many more rules.
This means, there are multiple formation of parsed tree given a sentence with many grammar rules.</p>
