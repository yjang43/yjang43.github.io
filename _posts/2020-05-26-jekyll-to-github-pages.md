GitHub page is not something new to me. When I first
learned about HTML and CSS, like all others wanted to do,
I tried to create a phat personal website.
However, I knew so little to make it look okay.

Several months later, as I learn more about website hosting
and etc. I realized there is no cheap way _for a college student like me_
to host a dynamic web sites. Reason is simple, you need a computer to
compute and render. So, I came back to GitHub page because they are free.
Then, I looked for static site generator that GitHub supports.

Jekyll was a standard one and very easy to understand. Some of the terms
were quite knew to me because Jekyll was a Ruby product, but many of them
can be disregarded without backfiring at your project.
