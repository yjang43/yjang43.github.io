title: Python Standard Library - threading.py

Python is my favorite language and yet I know so small compared to my passion for it. So, I looked through python documents because I recently stumbled upon socket programming and package in python and realized there are so many interesting built-in packages in python.

There is a package called threading. Thread instance can be created with Thread class and other instances for communication between threads can be created.

Ones I found easy to understand and important were Thread, Timer, and Event. One thing I found interesting is that standard way of terminating a thread is not provided in the document. There are few suggestions from online like causing exception, or hidden function _stop().

Python's queue package can be used to manage data between threads.
