The whole reason I came across the idea of DApp is because of the interview
with a company called _[Pilab](https://pilab.co/)_. This company tries to seek a solution
for a dilemma that DApp's platform always have: trade-offs in choosing a platform for the service.

_[Bifrost's white paper](https://thebifrost.io/static/Bifrost_WP_Eng.pdf)_ was interesting reading.
Even if I lacked a DApp background, with a simple understanding of block chain in general, and private and public
block chain, I was able to understand what problem Bifrost intend to solve.

According to the document, each block chain platform has a different focus as to
its implementation and ecosystem. Some focuses on scalability, and other focuses
on security and beyond.

As a programmer that needs to choose solely one platform, the risk or loss for
completely giving in one platform is a huge risk. Bifrost comes into place and solve
this dilemma by suggesting a framework, so to speak, that allows running two block
chain platforms in parallel from my understanding. My first concern was decrease in
its efficiency due to running two platforms compared to one, but they are working on
creating its own language called _Recipe_ that optimizes its performance.

I am excited to learn more about this technology in the future.
