            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                To Social Science Computing Cooperative, UW-Madison, I provided a python code to parse and export
                numerous HTML files into an XML file.
                This allowed to automate and fasten the process of migrating around 200 documents.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The script reformats HTML documents into XML so that they can be migrated to a new KB site. Prior to this,
                the script crawled <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu">https://ssc.wisc.edu</a> to receive all the documents
                within the domain, and then parsed to fit the required format.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                Web migration is a tricky operation to first-comer of such project because the project always sits on
                the risk of starting from the beginning if one does not know what's ahead. For example, we needed to
                preserve the mapping of our website because links within each document breaks without a proper mapping.
            </p>
            <h4>My Solution</h4>
            <p>
                There were many articles regarding the web migration, so I read to prevent us from slowing down the project.
                Also, I addressed the possible issues to my coworkers and mostly was able to find a better solution. through
                out communication.
