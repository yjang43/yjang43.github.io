            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                I took responsibility of designing a scheme and flow of the application. Also, I programmed
                GUI aspect of the application, including graph visualization, threading, and UI.

            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                Algotrade is a python application that allows automation of crypto currency trade
                using algorithm of a user's taste. The project is still under development.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                It was difficult to have a control of growing scale of the project as we add more and more functionality
                to the program. Especially file control and code tracing became a load of work every time there comes a
                need of adjustment.
            </p>
            <h4>My Solution</h4>
            <p>
                We decided to modulize the project so that we can make agile adjustment when the need comes.
