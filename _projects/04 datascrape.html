            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                There are so much data in the Internet, and yet they need data cleaning to be used in a Neural Network.
                To overcome the lack of clean data, I used hierarchical clustering algorithm with PCA to let machine label
                data.
            </p>
            <h4>Limitation to Note</h4>
            <p>
                The result of the project did not reach my expectation. Only the small portion of the original data
                was able to be labeled by the program. Also, due to the ambiguity that data transformation (PCA) creates,
                the arbitrary classification becomes insensible to human.
            </p>
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p>
                Although the project did not match to my expectation, I learned a scientific approach to ML problems,
                and this project is only the beginning of my journey to ML.
