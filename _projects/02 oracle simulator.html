            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                As an intern at PiLab, I was given a task to develop an efficient algorithm to return a price
                <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07140>Oracle</a> for a DeFi project.
                Learning that it lacks the definition of what the correct Oracle is, I had to set my own definition
                to seek for the best algorithm: resistance to market noise.
                Then, I made a simulator to visualize how each algorithm copes with market noise.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The project can retrieve and organize current market data into a pickle format that can be fed through
                the simulator. Then, it allows users to tweak each market data by clicking options. Then, by pressing
                an Oracle button, the program tells how resistant the Oracle is to the market noise.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Difficulty</h4>
            <p>
                Blockchain was an unfamiliar concept to me, and it required some time to understand the basics of
                technology and importance of Oracle. Make matters worse, as there is no clear discrete answer to such
                ambiguous problem (what is "the" oracle), it was difficult to set a direction in the beginning.
            </p>
            <h4>My Solution</h4>
            <p>
                From a Blockchain context, it can never be a perfect Oracle only with an algorithmic approach as
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Environment</a> needs to be
                considered. It requires network or hardware approach as
                well. Aside from such limitation, however, I read academic paper, articles, and compared with Oracle
                solutions of other DeFi examples to come out with the best algorithmic approach and realistic solution.
