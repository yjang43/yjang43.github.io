I am a forever-learning computer science student, and in real life working as a software engineer at Samsung Electronics.
Currently, my work is focused on building products that employs generative AI.

Aside from work, my interest lies in machine learning, especially in AI alignment.
The growth of AI has created an unseen impact within our lives, and the concern about the alignment of AI has become tangible.
I hope to study continue study in this direction, and hopefully, in some day, contribute to the society.
