I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University. My current interest lies in diffusion models and their connection to optimal transport. I believe this perspective will provide new breakthroughs in many applications. Specifically, I hope to apply this to the computer vision and robotics domains.

Aside from research, I like to play chess &#9823;.
